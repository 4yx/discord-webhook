A minimal online application to interact with Discord webhooks easily

***

The application is reachable on [webhook.yagiz.dev](https://webhook.yagiz.dev). While it only has the ability to send simple messages for now, I'm planning to integrate more advanced use cases like file uploads, embeds, and possibly more. I used jQuery, Font Awesome and Bootstrap in this project.

Feel free to create pull requests and issues, I'll check them. If you have any questions, reach me over [my socials](https://yagiz.dev) or [hi@yagiz.dev](mailto:hi@yagiz.dev).

For now, here is a short list of what's probably coming in the not-so-near future:
- [ ] file uploads
- [x] dark mode
- [ ] embeds
- [ ] twemoji support for preview
- [ ] next.js, maybe? (might have to move to Vercel then)
- [ ] better preview, previewing the icon, message, username, everything in Discord's style
- [x] retreive details automatically from webhook's predefined defaults (maybe attempt to do that automatically)
- [ ] see if I can drop jQuery
- [ ] dark mode toggle
- [ ] UI rewrite with Tailwind
- [ ] more services?
- [ ] make use of Go somewhere in the project because I like the idea?
