A minimal online application to interact with Discord webhooks easily

<hr>

The application is reachable on [discord-webhook.js.org](https://discord-webhook.js.org), while it only has the ability to send simple messages for now, I'm planning to integrate more advanced use cases like file uploads, embeds, and possibly more. I used jQuery, Font Awesome and Bootstrap in this project.

Feel free to create pull requests and issues, I'll check them. If you have any questions, reach me on Discord: evrifaessa#5791

For now, here is a short list of what's probably coming in the future:
- [ ] File uploads
- [x] Dark mode
- [ ] Embeds
- [ ] Twemoji support for preview
- [ ] express, maybe?
- [ ] Better preview, previewing the icon, message, username, everything in Discord's style
- [x] Retreive details automatically from webhook's predefined defaults
